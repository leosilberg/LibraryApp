      "shortDescription": "When her little boy is killed by a car on the way to school, it changes Stephanie Martin's life forever - in more ways than one. While recovering from the devastating blow, Steph realises she can now hear things others can't, such as the neighbourhood trees screaming in pain as they're cut down, her cat's demands for food... and other people's unspoken thoughts. As a counsellor helping clients overcome various problems, Steph finds this unexpected 'gift' both a curse and a blessing. It also fuels atheist Steph's conflict with her devoutly religious sister. But can it help her save another young boy's life?",

What other Rings of Power were circulating in medieval Europe? How did Thorin violate the rules of medieval kingship?</b><p>You’ll find the answers and more in this book, which explores the magic and creativity behind J.R.R. Tolkien’s bestselling story from a historical perspective. Tolkien was a professor of medieval languages and literature at Oxford University, and he drew on his scholarship—and the homely comforts common in his own day—to build the world of <i>The Hobbit.</i><p><i>The Hobbit and History</i> uncovers the parallels between the Middle Ages and the intricate culture of Middle-earth that Tolkien created in <i>The Hobbit</i>, showing how historical cultures provided the models for Tolkien’s characters, foods, riddles, and battle tactics. The book explores how European myths and legends inspired Tolkien’s wizards, dragons, and the monsters he created. Seeing Middle-earth and its peoples against these historical backdrops shines new light on the richness of Tolkien’s world, which is rooted in knowledge of European cultures as deep as the archive that Gandalf explores in Minas Tirith.<p>Filled with fascinating facts and reproductions of Tolkien’s original artwork of Smaug and other aspects of Middle-earth, <i>The Hobbit and History</i> is the missing piece for every book and movie fan and anyone who thought their J.R.R. Tolkien collection was complete.",
