      "shortDescription": "There may be no greater source of anxiety for Americans today than the question of what to eat and drink. Are eggs the perfect protein, or are they cholesterol bombs? Is red wine good for my heart or bad for my liver? Will pesticides, additives, and processed foods kill me? Here with some very rare and very welcome advice is food historian Harvey Levenstein: Stop worrying! In <i>Fear of Food</i> Levenstein reveals the people and interests who have created and exploited these worries, causing an extraordinary number of Americans to allow fear to trump pleasure in dictating their food choices. He tells of the prominent scientists who first warned about deadly germs and poisons in foods, and their successors who charged that processing foods robs them of life-giving vitamins and minerals. These include Nobel Prize–winner Eli Metchnikoff, who advised that yogurt would enable people to live to be 140 by killing the life-threatening germs in their intestines, and Elmer McCollum, the “discoverer” of vitamins, who tailored his warnings about vitamin deficiencies to suit the food producers who funded him. Levenstein also highlights how large food companies have taken advantage of these concerns by marketing their products to combat the fear of the moment. Such examples include the co-opting of the “natural foods” movement, which grew out of the belief that inhabitants of a remote Himalayan Shangri-la enjoyed remarkable health and longevity by avoiding the very kinds of processed food these corporations produced, and the physiologist Ancel Keys, originator of the Mediterranean Diet, who provided the basis for a powerful coalition of scientists, doctors, food producers, and others to convince Americans that high-fat foods were deadly. In <i>Fear of Food,</i> Levenstein offers a much-needed voice of reason; he expertly questions these stories of constantly changing advice to reveal that there are no hard-and-fast facts when it comes to eating. With this book, he hopes to free us from the fears that cloud so many of our food choices and allow us to finally rediscover the joys of eating something just because it tastes good. <br>",

      "shortDescription": "The goal of Molecules, Microbes, and Meals is to provide an overview of the science of food, exploring all aspects of how food products we purchase and consume come to have the characteristics they do. The key focus is on the science underpinning the appearance, flavor, texture and qualities of food, and the transformations that occur when we cook food products. Every food product is a highly complex scientific entity, and a key objective of the book is to show that an understanding of the science of food can enhance our appreciation and wonder at it. Another key theme will be the convergence of science and art in food, and the history of food, whereby we have known how to undertake what are exceptionally scientifically complex activities such as fermentation, pasteurization and cooking long before the scientific basis for what was happening was understood.",

Small businesses make up around two-thirds of businesses in Australia's food and beverage manufacturing industry. This book is aimed at those currently manufacturing food on a small-scale or those considering entering this market. It will assist those already operating a small business to develop a better understanding of key food safety systems, while those who are in the \"start-up\" phase will gain knowledge essential to provide their business with a solid food safety foundation.<br><br>The content will also be useful for students of food technology who wish to seek employment in the industry<br>or are planning on establishing their own manufacturing operation.<br><br><b>Key features</b><br>- Outlines the three food safety hazards: microbial, chemical and physical, with a special emphasis on microbial hazards and food recalls are explained<br>- Offers practical guidance on how to control food safety hazards<br>- Information is presented in a straightforward, instructive manner and key messages are highlighted at the end of each chapter",

Are you concerned she isn't getting enough nutrition, or that that your child's pickiness might be caused by a hidden medical issue? For every frustrated parent, the food chaining method offers a medically-proven, kid-tested solution.<br><br> Developed by a team of internationally known medical experts, <b>Food Chaining</b> helps you identify the reasons behind your child's picky eating habits -- be it medical, sensory, or because of allergies. Then, with a simple, 6-step method centered around taste, temperature, and texture, target foods are selected that are similar to the ones your child likes, gradually expanding to all food groups. Does your kid like French fries but won't touch veggies? Try hash browns, and slowly expand to sweet potato fries and zucchini sticks -- and then work your way to steamed vegetables.<br><br> With helpful information about common food allergies, lists of sample food chains, advice for special needs children, as well as a pre-chaining program to prevent food aversions before they develop, <b>Food Chaining</b> is your guide to raising lifelong health eaters.",
